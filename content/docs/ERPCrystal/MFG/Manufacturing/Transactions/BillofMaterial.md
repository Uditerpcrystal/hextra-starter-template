<!-- ### Steps to create a bill of material
- Main level BOM creation:
  1. The BOM will be auto-generated by the system you cannot create it.
  2. Item version will be by default as 01 and the date of the BOM creation will be the current date and it cannot be modified or changed.
  3. The product needs to be selected with the given drop-down. Also, you get the privilege of searching for the product you want a BOM of.
  4. You will also get a drop-down for the product line of code.
  5. Notes are non-mandatory.
- Line level BOM creation:
  1.  The BOM number will be fetched from the main level along with the version and the product you have created on the main level.
  2. To create Line level BOM you need to fill in some mandatory fields.
  3. First, we need to select the process for the BOM item you are going to create.
  4. Followed with the process you need to select the type of input for a single item you are creating. For example, your type of inputs can be Raw materials, Packing materials, etc.
  5. Then you have to select the item you want to create the BOM for, there is a search bar below the drop-down where you can search the item based on the item name or item id.
  6. Once the item is selected you need to select the stage of that item. There will be a dropdown you can select anyone it.
  7. Quantity is mandatory and needs to be filled.
  8. Rate is based on the drop-down named 'is manual rate'. If the dropdown is selected as yes then the rate needs to be filled in the given form else the rate will be taken from the price master for the selected item.
