<!-- ### Steps to Create a Production Plan.
- You cannot add a production plan number it will be generated by the system itself and it will be auto-incremented.
- Then you will get to select the year. It will show only the current financial year. Eg. 2022-23 or 2023-24 etc. 
- Then you will get a dropdown which will have three options. The first one will be production followed by that you will get projection plan and linked plan.
> Note :  TThe production plan will be by default. If you create a plan with the linked option then you won't be able to modify that in future.
- After the Type of plan is selected you need to set the start date and the end date of the type of plan you have selected.
- The start date cannot be more or less than the current financial year and the end date cannot be less than the start date and more than the end of the current financial year.
- Notes are non-mandatory. But you can specify the reason for creating the plan or for which production you are creating the plan. This will be beneficial in the future. -->
