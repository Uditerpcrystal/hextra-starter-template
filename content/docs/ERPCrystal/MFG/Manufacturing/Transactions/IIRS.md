<!-- ### Steps to create an IIRS:
- Main level IIRS creation:
  1. To create an IIRS you need to follow the steps given below.
  2. The first field of the IIRS is the year, which will be the current financial year and it can't be changed.
  3. The division will be auto-selected as 'NA' if you don't have any division.
  4. The plan is a dropdown of the production plans you have created. It is a non-mandatory field.
  5. Job no. or batch no. will be auto-generated by the system.
  6. Then you need to select the product that you need to manufacture.
  7. Then you need to select the product that you need to manufacture. You will get a search box where you can find a specific product based on the id of that product.
  8. After the product is selected you need to select the start date and the end date of manufacturing for that product.
  9. Then you need to specify where are you going to use the IIRS you are creating now.
  10. Refno and notes are no mandatory.
- Line level IIRS creation:
  1. The job no/batch no will be taken from the main level and displayed here so you will get to know if you are creating the correct IIRS or not. 
  2. If the selected option is 'in stock', then the given quantity will be added to the total quantity. If the selected option is out-stock then the given quantity will be subtracted from the total quantity.
  3. Once the type of stock is selected you need to specify the shift in which this item will be used to create the product.
  4. Then select the machine in which you are going to use this item.
  5. After, the machine is selected you need to select the process for this item. (you will get a dropdown, based on that you need to select the process).
  6. You need to select the date when you are going to use this item. After the date is selected you need to select the item you need to use followed by the brand, condition, stage, and store location.
  7. Once all these fields are filled you need to give the quantity you need for this item and it is a mandatory field (UOM 1). The UOM 2 is optional.
